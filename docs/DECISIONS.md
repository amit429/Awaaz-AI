## 2026-10-23: Twilio replaces Plivo, Exotel and Kalpa
- Plivo India numbers and domestic calling are for India-registered businesses only (GST, incorporation or Udyam). India does not support Verified Caller ID. An individual cannot get a number.
- Exotel WhatsApp Business onboarding is slow (KYC, Meta verification, templates).
- Decision: Twilio for voice (Media Streams, trial calls to verified numbers) and the WhatsApp sandbox. Clear voice uses Cartesia with speed control instead of Kalpa.
- Unverified: caller ID shown on Indian destinations; DTMF during a Media Stream (needs a call update); sandbox interactive buttons; Twilio upgrade cost for calling unverified numbers.
- Tunnel: ngrok with one static domain for webhooks and media WebSockets.
